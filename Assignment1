## in a comma-separated sequence on a single line.
lst1=[]
for x in range(2000,3001):
    if x%7==0:
        if x%5==0:
            lst1.append(x)
print(lst1)


## Assignment 1.2

text2=last_name[::-1]
print("{} {}".format(text2,text1))

## Formula: V=4/3 * Ï€ * r*r*r
r=12/2
pi=3.14
v=(4.0/3.0)*pi*r*r*r
